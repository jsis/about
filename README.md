# Javascript Iceland

### About
We are the Icelandic Javascript usergroup. We organize meetups for the Icelandic developer community.

### How we are organized
We have few organizers and they are listed here https://github.com/orgs/jsis/people.
People who are eager to help out can join the organizing team when they show good work. Everyone who is willing to do something should be able to.

### How we meet up
Currently we have [monthly meetup](https://github.com/jsis/monthly-meetup) and a informal [weekly meetup](https://github.com/jsis/reykjavikjs-website) as well.

### If you want to host a meetup
Everyone is able to host a new meetup under the JS Iceland umbrella. Create a pull request or an issue!
